I am pursuing MBA (Information Technologies & Operations), graduated with B.tech (Mechanical Engineering), and a certificate in Data Analytics.
As an aspiring data analyst, I am passionate about using data-driven insights to solve complex business problems.
During my academic journey, I gained proficiency in Excel, SQL, and Python, and acquired knowledge of data visualization tools such as Tableau.
I also have a solid foundation in statistical concepts and techniques, and have a knack for identifying trends and patterns in data.
In the projects, I leveraged my skills to analyze the sales data of an online house price prediction model,
build a predictive model to forecast customer churn for a telecom company and conduct sentiment analysis on customer reviews of a hotel chain.
I am a quick learner, and a team player, and possess excellent communication and interpersonal skills.
I am eager to start my career as a data analyst and contribute to the growth and success of a dynamic organization.
